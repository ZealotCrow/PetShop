                <h3>The world balances on a paper sheet tonight</h3>
                <p>I've been given the reigns to a whore of a sleigh and I plan on using it. My name is Christian Tulloss and I am ZEALOT. ZEALOT is my baby. It may shit the bed and wake me up crying at 4am but I did that myself before I came up with it so whatever, right? Anywho, this is my playground and I plan on hoarding the swings.</p>
                <p>Toxic strawberry means a lot of things. It is both sweet and dangerous. I, at several times in my  life, have thought the same way about my self. Edgy, I know, but true. Completely true. I am 19 and turning 20 next month. I have seen a lot in those 20 years and I can't say that I regret all of my decisions. Now believe me when I say that I have a few decisions that I regret making but I'm okay with my life.</p>
                <p>First things first, I am an agent of chaos and I'm not ashamed to admit. There are things about my nature that I seek to work on but overall I enjoy the person I am. I do, however, get the occasional spring of anxiety about the potential meanings of my actions and about the consequences of my action but I believe that I will ultimately be okay.</p>

                <h2>What is it that you desire, young monarch?</h2>
                <p>I am not completely sure about the things that I want. I have thought about that for a long time. When I was a kid, I wanted the world. I wanted to be king. I wanted to own everything and I wanted everyone to be my friend. Now that I am older, I wish for quiet, calm, peace-of-mind, and carnal pleasures. When I was 17, I noticed that my emotions were going through a change. I found myself getting a lot more emotional then I would have previously. Crying, anger, sexuality: everything was coming at me at once. Looking back at it now, I don't think what I was going through was all that abnormal but at the time life was scary and uncomfortable. Even know I have the slight twinge of uncertainty. As I type this, my main desire is to make sense of everything. To get it all out so that I can have the sensation of peace. Honestly, how isn't that feeling not addictive. Heroin can't calm you like that feeling could.</p>
                <p>Life is chaos. I won't say that it isn't. As I type this, it is the second day of 2021. 2020 was a fucking shitstorm and I was severly unhappy during it and neither was anyone else. Top to Bottom, the world was irrevocably altered by the events of 2020. I was in a bad way that I left due to the efforts of my very good close friends. Make friends, trust me. It's not that hard and they do cool shit like listen to you bitch and complain at  3 am. Now I'm rambling on a model site. This is getting pretty meta, huh? I often think about how my family would cry for me if I died or got arrested or something. Is that egotism? I hate making people worried about me. I don't speak to my family about things like my mental health. I have my friends for that. They are way more fucked up than I am so I feel comfortable about doing to them about my issues. It's like going to a cancer patient about a cough. I love those people so fucking much.</p>
                <p>It's kinda hard to describe what I want. I want to be happy, like everyone else. I want to get laid and get a burger and then lose weight and look like a supermodel and this and that. I made ZEALOT to express those feelings. Part fashion, part self-discovery. My desire is to make something that I can do until it kills me. I want to love something so much that it physically hurts to not do it. I want to become addicted to the things that I'm passionate about. My drive is terrible and I have to focus super hard to stay motivated. I wish I could do things with little thought. I wish things just came to me. I want my life to be stress-free. Maybe I'll find it one day. Maybe not. I want to try before I fall.</p>

                <h2>Where did ZEALOT come from?</h2>
                <p>I started college in 2019. During my first semester, I was taking terrible Introduction to Algebra courses at the time because my ACT test scores were abyssmal(thanks for gauging my aptitude of math on a four hour test that encourages using gimmicks and not READING THE FUCKING QUESTION TO COMPLETION, AMERICA! NOW I HAVE TO TAKE A SHIT LOAD OF GEN-ED CLASSES THAT I TOOK IN HIGH SCHOOL FUCK YOU!). Anyway, between watching anime and actively expressing my disdain for the class to the professor, I would doodle on a pair of shitty work gloves that I was using as winter gloves. At the time, I was an angry atheist who wanted to erase religion from the face of the earth like a fourteen year old Joker. I was probably thinking something along the lines of,"Heh, I can't wait to decimate the institution of religion with these dope-ass designs!" Keep in mind, I still am pretty resistant towards religion as I believe that it is antiquated and unnecessary to the modern world. I am not straight and I am happy to be who I am and religion tells me that I should change who I am for someone who isn't me. I can't abide by that. Keep in mind that this was before I discovered my love of older women and drag shows so life fucking blew. There was this cool guy I would sit next to and talk about anime with. His name was Gabriel Somethingorothernoidea(I think he was foreign). I was talking shit and doodling anything that came to my mind when I started thinking of my family's church. I was probably calling them all zealots who would do anything for their storybook. I think that's were ideas come from: blind unreasonable hatred towards organized religions. I wanted to harm the concept of religion because I saw it as something that worked against my personal agency.</p>
                <p>I wanted to make blasphemy an art. I wanted to show the world the negatives of Christianity. I was so damn edgy that I refused to spell god with a capital 'g'. Really stickin' it to the man with that lame bullshit, huh? That's my protest and the only thing that's peaceful is the piece full of god's ass after I sodomize him while eating his mom's box like a Taco Bell special. I drew crosses with scratches to make it super edgy and dark. I was using my hatred for ideas.</p>
