            <h3>The world balances on a paper sheet tonight</h3>
            <p>I've been given the reigns to a whore of a sleigh and I plan on using it. My name is Christian Tulloss and I am ZEALOT. ZEALOT is my baby. It may shit the bed and wake me up crying at 4am but I did that myself before I came up with it so whatever, right? Anywho, this is my playground and I plan on hoarding the swings.</p>
            <p>Toxic strawberry means a lot of things. It is both sweet and dangerous. I, at several times in my  life, have thought the same way about my self. Edgy, I know, but true. Completely true. I am 19 and turning 20 next month. I have seen a lot in those 20 years and I can't say that I regret all of my decisions. Now believe me when I say that I have a few decisions that I regret making but I'm okay with my life.</p>
            <p>First things first, I am an agent of chaos and I'm not ashamed to admit <that class="0"></that></p>
